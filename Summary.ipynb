    "**Aim**: probe the influence of the inner stable zone in the magnetic field properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Method**: We perform 3D MHD simulations in spherical geometry. Our computational domain covers a full shell with inner radius $r_\\mathrm{i}$ and outer radius $r_\\mathrm{o}$. Two different setups are considered in this work: **(i)** a fiducial fully convective setup, which consists of a spherical shell with aspect ratio $r_\\mathrm{i}/r_\\mathrm{o} =0.6$; and **(ii)** a partially convective setup with aspect ratio $r_\\mathrm{i}/r_\\mathrm{o} =0.4$. The setup of the latter is essentially the convective zone of model (i) with an additional inner stable zone. \n",
