# Reports of simulations 

## Rendering the reports:
go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org and paste the github link to the notebook.


## _Notebooks_:

- Notebook 0: HD simulations with different aspect ratio;

- Notebook 1: Test Nphi resolution for 3 grids;

- Notebook 2: Compare cases with different initial fields. One starting from flow and magnetic conditions of previous run, another also starting from previous run but imposing a strong dipole again, and, finally, one case with a strong dipole initialized with a random velocity field;

- Notebook 3.1: Check the boundary condition impact in the fully convective case;
    
- Notebook 3.2: Check the boundary condition impact in the partially convective case;
